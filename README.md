## About The Project
 This ia a project on BLE beaconing based indoor localization. There are many techniques that are used to identify a location on a map with the improvement of
technology. In addition the significant and popularity of indoor navigation has increased in the
recent past. So our purpose is studying the concept of indoor navigation. Here we use BLE beacons
for that. Then BLE messages are scanned using the arduino ESP32 module. Then those data are
uploaded to a MQTT server under a given topic using an access point. Then we collect a data set
and hope to train that data set for finding out the correct location.
